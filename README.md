# Terrace

Terrace is a social media de-addiction app that aims to gamify your screentime. The app displays a beautiful night sky that dynamically responds to your phone usage - the more time you spend on your device, the more light polluted your personal sky becomes. The app features a gamified social system where you can view other users' skies. By turning screen time management into a collaborative stargazing experience, Terrace aims to make digital wellness both beautiful and engaging.
